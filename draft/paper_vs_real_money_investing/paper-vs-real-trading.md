## Paper vs Real‑Money Investing: Building Skills Before Committing Capital

Paper trading and simulated investing provide risk‑free environments for learning strategies before committing real money. Platforms like Moolah Capital (fund investing) and TradingView (day trading) offer professional‑grade simulations that mirror live markets and enable strategy development.

### 1. Understanding Paper Trading and Virtual Investing

* **Virtual Portfolio Management**

  * Mirror real‑account functionality: position tracking, P/L, performance analytics

    * e.g. Start with £50 000 virtual cash, buy 200 shares of AAPL at market price, then track daily P/L.
    * Allocate virtual cash (e.g. £10 000–£1 000 000) to test strategies

    * e.g. Allocate £100 000 into a 50/50 equity‑bond split to test long‑term allocation.
